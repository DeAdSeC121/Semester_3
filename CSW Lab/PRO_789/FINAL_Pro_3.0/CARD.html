            <p class="card-text">As a result of decreasing government funds and increasing competition, institutions of higher education have propelled themselves into business practices such as branding. Despite the growing literature on branding in higher education, there is little research on the relationship between alumni donor motivations and the university brand. This study explores donor motivations from social identity and self‐congruity theoretical perspectives. The authors used zero‐inflated negative binomial regression to assess the relationship between identification and count of donations. The results showed that if the level of identification with the university increased, the expected number of donations would also increase. The study further assessing the “zeros” (non‐donors), the results suggested that if an alumnus were to identify with the university, he would be 43% less likely to be “certain zero” (definitive non‐donor) and would find a way to give money. Additionally, the authors analyzed responses about why alumni donate and why they choose not to donate. The authors offered observations on the basis of respondent commentary and also raised the question of what happens when university branding efforts conflict with the perceptions of a large stakeholder group such as alumni.

            <p class="card-text">Hemsley-Brown & Goonawardana, 2007; Melewar &Akel, 2005).Branding refers to the practice of enhancing theperceived value of an entity by augmenting a “clusterof functional and emotional values”(de Chernatony,2001, p. 13). In the past 20years, the focus hasshifted from branding the product or service to theoverall institution referred to as the corporate brand(Balmer, Liao, & Wang, 2010; Balmer & Liao, 2007;Balmer & Gray, 2003; de Chernatony, 2001). The ben-efits of establishing a corporate brand in highereducation are similar to those in the nonprofit andfor-profit sectors. Advocates of branding in academiahighlight benefits such as the establishment ofprestige and legitimacy (Chapleo, 2011; Waeraas &Solbakk, 2008), the communication of organizationalvalues as a mental hook potentially eliciting supportfrom stakeholders (Sargeant, Hudson, & West, 2008;Sargeant & Ford, 2007), and the reduction of riskthrough an expression of quality (Chapleo, 2011;Judson, Aurand, Gorch</p>
