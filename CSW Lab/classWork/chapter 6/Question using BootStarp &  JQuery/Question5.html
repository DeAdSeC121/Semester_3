The New Year starts on January 1st of every year. It is the time to start over, make new resolutions, and look forward to a great future ahead. The New Year is a special time for all people as they feel a renewed sense of responsibility in their lives. However, the first day of the New Year always starts a bit slow for everyone as they are still tired from the party from the last day of the previous year.
